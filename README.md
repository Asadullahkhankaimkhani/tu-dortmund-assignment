M.Sc. Data Science Application Project
Description
This repository contains the analysis and report for the application to the M.Sc. Data Science program at TU Dortmund. The analysis focuses on examining the relationship between passing rates in German 1st Division Bundesliga soccer games and the likelihood of winning.

Data
The data used for this analysis is sourced from TU Dortmund's statistics department and can be found in the passes.csv file. This dataset includes passing rates for teams in the 1st Bundesliga, identified by a unique game ID, and indicates whether the team won the game or not.

Analysis
The analysis includes the following steps:

Descriptive analysis of the dataset, including summary statistics and visualizations.
Hypothesis testing to answer two questions:
Does the winner of a game have a higher passing rate than the loser?
Is the expected difference in passing rate in games that end in a draw different from the expected difference in passing rate in games with a winner?
How to Run
To replicate the analysis, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries.seaborn,matplotlib and pandas
Run the Jupyter Notebook analysis.ipynb to execute the analysis code.
